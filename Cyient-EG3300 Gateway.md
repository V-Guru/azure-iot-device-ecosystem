# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect Cyient EG3300 device running on RTOS with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Update config file to device to set Azure credentials

<a name="Pre-requisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Buy EG3300 from Cyient][Cyient-EG3300]
-   Update Credentials in EG3300

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

- The Modular IoT Gateway EG3300 is a ready-to-deploy, industrial-grade, gateway for advanced Internet of Things applications. Modular IoT Gateway EG3300 supports wireless applications including GPS, Wi-Fi, and 2G/3G/4G cellular and wired connectivity such as USB 2.0, Gigabit Ethernet, serial ports, CAN 2.0b, analog inputs, and isolated digital I/O.
- Read the manual to power on device and make sure it is connected to internet via Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
- Configure the EG3300 with information by accessing the Webserver portal (ex: like any typical wifi router configuration) that would be provided with purchase of EG3300
