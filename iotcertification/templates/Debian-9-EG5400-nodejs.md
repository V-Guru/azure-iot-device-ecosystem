# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect Cyient EG5400 gateway device running Debian 9.12 GNU/Linux 9.12 with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   Computer with Git client installed 
-   Cyient EG5400 gateway device.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   The Modular IoT Gateway 5400 is a ready-to-deploy, industrial-grade, gateway for advanced Internet of Things applications. It is a smart device that enables communications, edge computational power, simplified application deployment, and integration with Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine to Machine (M2M) platforms for immediate service generation. It provides a capable communication architecture and offers connectivity to a wide range of sensors and edge devices making it easy to collect data from the field and deliver it to your business application. Modular IoT Gateway 5400 supports wireless applications including GPS, Wi-Fi, and 2G/3G/4G cellular and wired connectivity such as USB 2.0, Gigabit Ethernet, serial ports, CAN 2.0b, analog inputs, and isolated digital I/O.
- Read the manual to power on device and make sure it is connected to internet via Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
- Read the Manual to connect EG5400 gateway through putty.

# Step 3: Build and Run the Sample

<a name="Load"></a>
## 3.1 Load the Azure IoT bits and prerequisites on device

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the EG5400 device.

-   Run following command to check if NodeJS is already installed

        node --version

    If version is **0.12.x or greater**, then skip next step of installing prerequisite packages. Else uninstall it by issuing following command from command line on the device.

        sudo apt-get remove nodejs

-   Install the prerequisite packages by issuing the following commands from the command line on the device. 


        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo bash -

        sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
     
    **Note:** To test successful installation of Node JS, try to fetch its version information by running following command:

        node --version

-   Run following command to install pm2 

        apt-get install pm2

-   Download the SDK to the board by issuing the following command in
    PuTTY:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node.git

-   Verify that you now have a copy of the source code under the directory ~/azure-iot-sdk-node.

<a name="BuildSamples"></a>
## 3.2 Build the samples

-   To validate the source code run the following commands on the device.

        export IOTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING='<iothub_connection_string>'

    Replace the `<iothub_connection_string>` placeholder with IoTHub Connection String you got in [Step 1](#Prerequisites).    

-   Run the following commands 

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-node
        build/dev-setup.sh
        build/build.sh | tee LogFile.txt

    ***Note:*** *LogFile.txt in above command should be replaced with a file name where build output will be written.*

-   Install npm package to run sample.

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples
	
    **For HTTP Protocol:**
	
        npm install azure-iot-device-http
	
    **For MQTT Protocol:**

        npm install azure-iot-device-mqtt	

-   To update sample, run the following command on device.

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples
        nano simple_sample_device.js

-   This launches a console-based text editor. Scroll down to the
    protocol information.
    
-   Find the below code:

        var Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-amqp').Amqp;
	
    The default protocol used is AMQP. Code for other protocols(HTTP/MQTT) are mentioned just below the above line in the script.
    Uncomment the line as per the protocol you want to use.


-   Scroll down to the connection information.
    Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        var connectionString = "[IoT Device Connection String]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string. You can get this from DeviceExplorer as explained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites), that you copied into Notepad.

-   Save your changes by pressing Ctrl+O and when nano prompts you to save it as the same file, just press ENTER.

-   Press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

-   Run the following command before leaving the **~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples** directory

        npm link azure-iot-device

## 3.3 Run and Validate the Samples

### 3.3.1 Send Device Events to IOT Hub

-   Run the sample by issuing following command and verify that data has been successfully sent and received.

        node ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples/simple_sample_device.js

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

### 3.3.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
